# Chess Square Color Trainer

This script will drill the user in which color a randomly generated chess
coordinate is. The idea is to be able to visualize the chess board to better
perform calculations for tactics and positions.

Doing this sort of training without looking at the chessboard, for instance on
a website, ideally further facilitates seeing the chess board in your mind's
eye.

Currently the 'training' occurs through trial and error.

TODO - Something I intend to add soon is a --train option which will somehow
show the coordinate and color on the screen. I'm not sure how I want to
implement it though.
